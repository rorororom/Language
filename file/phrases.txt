It is easy to notice that
When the derivative says 'jump', don't ask 'why', just jump!
When your equation is complex, differentiation brings ease into life!
The derivative of this part is explicitly expressed by the following mathematical expression:
After applying certain methods of function differentiation, we obtained the mathematical expression:
Upon simplification, we get:
As they say, well, here it is:
Let's differentiate this part of the original function:
It's so difficult to live when there are only 24 hours in a day, it would be easier if there were more!
Differentiate as if your life depends on it... and maybe it really does...
When you differentiate, imagine that your variables are your favorite dumplings, and you're separating them to discover their secret recipe.
It is obvious that it turns out like this:
This is trivial.
The key is to breathe calmly, then you can obtain:
